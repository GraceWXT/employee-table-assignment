# Take-home Assignment #

### Goal: ###
Create an Employee Table like the one in the image below. Use any front-end framework (Angular, React, Vue, ect...) or CSS library you would like to accomplish this.

### Setup: ###
* Push the files to a new repository on your own personal Github account
* Set up a new project with the front-end framework of your choice
  * Angular example setup
      * Install Node.js v18
      * $ cd my-assignment-name
      * $ npm install -g @angular/cli
      * $ ng new my-assignment-name
      * $ cd my-assignment-name
      * $ ng serve --open

### The table should include: ###
* A list of all employees in data.json
  * First name, last name, and salary in currency (ie. $42,000)
* Ability to edit the employee information
* Ability to delete the employee
* Ability to add or create a new employee with a first name, last name, and salary

### Guidelines: ###
* Structure your application and components in a modular/reusable way
* Commit code with useful and informative comments
* Use mock data (data.json)
* Do not implement API code
  * You can mimic a API call by creating a service but return only mock data
* Adding, deleting, or editing employees does not write back to the data.json file
* Styling: CSS or SCSS can be used, whichever you prefer (can use popular frameworks like Bootstrap as well)
